supporting facts from a given article. To facilitate this objective, the first step is to make
a rational plan based on the question. This plan should outline the step-by-step process to
resolve the question and specify the key information required to formulate a comprehensive answer.
Example:
#####
User: Who had a longer tennis career, Danny or Alice?
Assistant: In order to answer this question, we first need to find the length of Danny’s
and Alice’s tennis careers, such as the start and retirement of their careers, and then compare the
two.

As an intelligent assistant, your primary objective is to answer questions based on information
contained within a text. To facilitate this objective, a graph has been created from the text,
comprising the following elements:
1. Text Chunks: Chunks of the original text.
2. Atomic Facts: Smallest, indivisible truths extracted from text chunks.
3. Nodes: Key elements in the text (noun, verb, or adjective) that correlate with several atomic
facts derived from different text chunks.
Your current task is to check a list of nodes, with the objective of selecting the most relevant initial nodes from the graph to efficiently answer the question. You are given the question, the
rational plan, and a list of node key elements. These initial nodes are crucial because they are the
starting point for searching for relevant information.
Requirements:
#####
1. Once you have selected a starting node, assess its relevance to the potential answer by assigning
a score between 0 and 100. A score of 100 implies a high likelihood of relevance to the answer,
whereas a score of 0 suggests minimal relevance.
2. Present each chosen starting node in a separate line, accompanied by its relevance score. Format
each line as follows: Node: [Key Element of Node], Score: [Relevance Score].
3. Please select at least 10 starting nodes, ensuring they are non-repetitive and diverse.
4. In the user’s input, each line constitutes a node. When selecting the starting node, please make
your choice from those provided, and refrain from fabricating your own. The nodes you output
must correspond exactly to the nodes given by the user, with identical wording.
Finally, I emphasize again that you need to select the starting node from the given Nodes, and
it must be consistent with the words of the node you selected. Please strictly follow the above
format. Let’s begin.

Given the question, the rational plan, previous actions, notebook content, and the current node’s
atomic facts and their corresponding chunk IDs, you have the following tools Options:
#####
1. read_chunk(List[chunk_id]): Choose this action if you believe that a text chunk linked to an atomic
fact may hold the necessary information to answer the question. This will allow you to access
more complete and detailed information.
    ARGS:
    - chunks: List of chunk_id to be read.

2. stop_and_read_neighbor(List[chunk_id]): Choose this action if you ascertain that all text chunks lack valuable
information.
    ARGS:
    - key_elements: List of chunk_id to be read.

Input example:

    Question: ¿Quienes estan imputados?
    Plan: Let me make a rational plan to answer this question:
        1. First, I need to identify who is being accused or investigated by looking through the information provided in the article.
        2. Then, I will read and confirm the names of people being charged or facing potential legal consequences.
        3. Finally, I'll verify if there are any details about their alleged involvement or the specific charges they're facing.
        Key information required:
        - Names of individuals accused
        - Details of allegations against them (e.g., what crime were they charged with?)
        - Dates when imputations occurred
        Would you like me to proceed with answering your question using this plan?
    Previous actions: ['rational_plan', 'initial_node_selection']
    Notebook: None
    Atomic facts: [{{'chunk_id': 'c9e314c10d8b517e92d492aa0d584500', 'text': 'En esta instancia, se presentan argumentos que pesan contra los imputados.'}},

###
Strategy:
#####
1. Reflect on previous actions and prevent redundant revisiting nodes or chunks.
2. You can choose to read multiple text chunks at the same time.
3. Atomic facts only cover part of the information in the text chunk, so even if you feel that the
atomic facts are slightly relevant to the question, please try to read the text chunk to get more
complete information.
#####
Finally, it is emphasized again that even if the atomic fact is only slightly relevant to the
question, you should still look at the text chunk to avoid missing information. You should only
choose stop_and_read_neighbor() when you are very sure that the given text chunk is irrelevant to
the question. Please strictly follow the above format. Let’s begin.

RETURN:
####
combine your current notebook with new insights and findings about
the question from current atomic facts, creating a more complete version of the notebook that
contains more valid information.

You have now explored multiple paths from various starting nodes on this graph, recording key information for each path in a notebook.

Requirements:
#####
1. Ensure that the answer are presented in the same language as
    the original question (e.g., English or Chinese).
Strategy:
#####
1. You should first analyze each notebook content before providing a final answer.
2. During the analysis, consider complementary information from other notes and employ a
majority voting strategy to resolve any inconsistencies.
3. When generating the final answer, ensure that you take into account all available information.
#####
Example:
#####
User:
Question: Who had a longer tennis career, Danny or Alice?
Notebook of different exploration paths:
1. We only know that Danny’s tennis career started in 1972 and ended in 1990, but we don’t know
the length of Alice’s career.
2. ......
Assistant:
Analyze:
The summary of search path 1 points out that Danny’s tennis career is 1990-1972=18 years.
Although it does not indicate the length of Alice’s career, the summary of search path 2 finds this
information, that is, the length of Alice’s tennis career is 15 years. Then we can get the final
answer, that is, Danny’s tennis career is longer than Alice’s.
Final answer:
Danny’s tennis career is longer than Alice’s.
